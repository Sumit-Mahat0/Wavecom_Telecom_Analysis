📢 Key Findings & Strategic Recommendations    
🚨 Key Challenges Identified:   
	🔹 Revenue Drop (-0.50%) despite ARPU growth (+11.05%), signaling customer churn issues.   
	🔹 High user churn: -8.28% active users, +23.5% unsubscribed users – urgent retention strategy needed.   
	🔹 Plan 7 Failure: 73% revenue drop – requires revision or replacement.   
🚀 Recommended Actions:   
	✅ Customer Retention: Offer targeted loyalty discounts and exclusive 5G perks.
